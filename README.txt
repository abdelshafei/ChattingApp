To run first install the dependencies in package.json by executing:
    > npm install

Then run:
    > node server.js

To try the application open several browser instances at the address:
    ```http://localhost:3000/chatClient.html```

This demonstrates my ability with real-time concurrent users with the use of web sockets and such. 

Additional instructions:
    1 - To private chat -> you must enter the name of the user then type ":" right after it and then write your message.
    2 - To group chat   -> likewise with the private chat but you must enter the names of the recievers seperated by " ,".
